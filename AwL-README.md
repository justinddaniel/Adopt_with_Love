# Adopt_with_Love
"This gem scrapes from the Human Society of Southwest Michigan and 
generates a CLI where users can choose if they would like a dog or cat. 
The CLI then returns a list of dogs/cats scraped from the website. 
Users can then choose one of those dogs/cats and the CLI returns 
a link to that animal's  profile page."

"It is designed mostly as a 'proof of concept' exercise to show how 
a scraper and command line interface can be used to interact with 
data taken from the Internet."

"To call the command line interface type './bin/awlove' in the terminal."

"This Gem requires the following other gems: nokogiri, bundler/setup, and open-uri. 
It is designed to automatically install the required gems when ran, but if some 
dependencies do not autoload then type 'bundle install' in the terminal and press
enter and this should solve the problem. All required files and gems are in the 
file config/environment.rb."

"This gem was constructed from a skeleton of files and dependencies downloaded
from the bundler gem. As such it has some legacy files that should not be tampered
with. See the config/environment file for more details." 

"For further information about its usage restrictions, licensing, and code source 
please refer to the files in the folder Ruby_Gem_info."
